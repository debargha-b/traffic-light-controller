# traffic-light-controller
This FPGA-based intelligent traffic light controller dynamically adjusts green-light duration based on real-time traffic density and prioritizes emergency vehicles. Simulation results show significant improvements over fixed-timing systems, making it suitable for modern urban intersections.
